Improve the "prefer" notation with a different arrow.

Consult: It seems there's a typo in GID: the description of 'akademi'
should be '1*' instead of '*1'. It doesn't seem to mean "words not
original GEO (Clark/Ashby)", because there's also a "1" (words that
appear in one of the several "Glosa 1000" lists).
