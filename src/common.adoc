== About this e-book

This e-book was built from the data of the
http://www.glosa.org/gid/[Glosa Internet Dictionary], the most
comprehensive Glosa dictionary.  Its initial goal was to make
the dictionary easier to use during my studying of Glosa.

There are several variants of this e-book, depending on the contents
(English-Glosa, Glosa-English or both) the layout (tables, lists or
paragraphs), and the file format (EPUB, HTML and eventually others).
The latest version of all of them, and the devolopment repository, can
be found in http://ne.alinome.net[ne alinome].

// Usage {{{1
== Usage

The dictionary has three levels:

1. "Core" (or "Centra", small)   = marked with `++`
2. "Basic" (or "Basi", middle)   = marked with `++` and `+`
3. "Literary" (or "Mega", large) = all words

Suggestion: prefer words with `++`, then take `+`.

Abbreviations:
