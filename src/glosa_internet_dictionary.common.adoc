== About this e-book

This book contains a copy of the http://www.glosa.org/gid/[Glosa
Internet Dictionary], last updated on 2013-04-30 by its current
maintainer, Marcel Springer.

The goal of this book was to make the dictionary easier to use during
my studying of Glosa.

== Usage

The dictionary has three levels:

1. "Core" (or "Centra", small)   = marked with `++`
2. "Basic" (or "Basi", middle)   = marked with `++` and `+`
3. "Literary" (or "Mega", large) = all words

Suggestion: prefer words with "++", then take "+".

Other abbreviations:

`G`:: Glosa words with Greek origin
`1`:: "Glosa 1000" (words that appear in one of the several "Glosa 1000" lists)
`*`:: words not original GEO (Clark/Ashby)
`1*`:: words slightly modificated from Glosa-1000-words
`X`:: words to be avoided; in brackets, the prefered synonym
`adj`:: adjective
`n`:: noun
`v`:: verb
